# FlightGear Final Project
Thanks to our lecturer, Dr. Eliahu Khalastchi

This project is the final project of the advanced software
development course at the College of Management.

This course combines elements of object-oriented software
engineering and advanced programming. The course is a significant leap in the ability to
design and write code.
In the course we discussed parallel programming using threads, event driven programming
with GUI, Architectural Patterns, Code optimizations etcâ€¦
All of these are reflected in the project in our graduation project
